Note: In principle, no make-up policy applies to all the quizzes. If you want to make up quizzes, provide a doctor's note. If you didn't have time to see a doctor, explain your conditions to your instructor. We may / may not let you make up quizzes depending on your situations.

19.  _Attendance Policy:_
    1.  It is essential that you attend all sessions and keep up with the course work on a daily basis. Keep in mind success in a language course is a cumulative process. If you feel you are falling behind, contact the instructor immediately.
    2.  If you have an unavoidable reason for your absence, please email the instructors before class.
    3.  Attend the class section you are registered in unless you have made official arrangements with the instructor at the beginning of the semester, or your grade will not be credited.
    4.  _Be punctual_. Coming in late not only results in missed performances and quizzes that may not be made up for, but also distracts other students. Showing up late may affect your daily grade negatively.
    5.  No eating or text messaging will be allowed during class.
20.  _Homework Policy:_

Submit all assignments at the beginning of the class. Your homework will be graded by letter grades (such as "A", "B+", etc.). Late submission can be accepted with deduction in grades. Assignments turned in after three days will not receive any credits, however.
